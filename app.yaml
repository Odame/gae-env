# The Python SDK includes a number of built-in handlers for common application functions.
# The builtins directive allows you to include specific handlers in app.yaml.

builtins:
  # https://cloud.google.com/appengine/articles/deferred
- deferred: on

# Handlers define how to route requests to your application.

# This handler tells app engine how to route requests to a WSGI application.
# The script value is in the format <path.to.module>.<wsgi_application>
# where <wsgi_application> is a WSGI application object.
